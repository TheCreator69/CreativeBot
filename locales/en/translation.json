They aren't meant for them however and can be **granted to other server members by vouching** for them with the `%vouch` command.\nYou can award them to whomever you like. TheCreator awards Tokens to users based on __three key points__:\n**Consistency:** the user is an __active and recurring__ member\n**Quality:** the user posts __meaningful messages__ which add something to the conversation\n**Kindness:** the user is __nice__ :innocent:\n\nThe top \"earners\" will be **displayed on a leaderboard** (accessible with the `%leaderboard` command). If they manage to hold a spot on there __for at least three days__, they will get **access to exclusive content**, like __sneak peaks__ of TheCreator's upcoming work and other __behind the scenes footage__. :star_struck:\n\nAt the end of each month, the Creative Token balance is **reset for everyone** and the fun begins anew."
