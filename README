# Welcome to the Creative Bot repo!
Before you lies the source code for my very own Discord Bot. Feel free to pitch in or fork this thing!
## What is this bot?
I'm glad I asked. This bot is mainly meant for my personal server and is thus tailored to my specific needs.
It is not a general purpose bot and it doesn't aim to be. This has a big impact on its feature set and technical design.
## Technical Details
This repo tries to adhere to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html), with some exceptions.
Currently, solutions for unit testing and logging are being explored.
The library being used is [DiscordCoreAPI](https://discordcoreapi.com/), written for C++20.
## State of Development
Currently, this bot is still in its infancy as I try to reimagine it completely, down to the most minute detail.
A previous iteration of the bot still exists, but it suffers from massive code debt. Explore at your own risk!
### Wrapping Up
That's it for now. This README will be updated when the project has progressed in any significant way.
Thank you for reading til this point! :smile:
