# Creative Bot

This discord bot is being created by TheCreator with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), using discord.js.\
**It is intended for my personal use only.**\
I have still added support for multiple servers, just in case, even though I just have one at the moment. Sharding is not supported, however.

## What it can do
- [x] Fun Commands: generate a random game idea, simulate a slot machine and create an inspiring Obama image
- [x] Creative Tokens System: all members get 10 tokens each day that they can use to vouch for active members
- [x] Event System: I'd like to host regular events on my Discord and my bot will help me with this :smile:
